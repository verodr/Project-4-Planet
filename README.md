# Project-4-Planet
For my fourth project, I built  a full-stack application from scratch creating a Python Django API for the back-end and using React for the front-end.
I created this app driven by the desire to build a place where all people from all over the world can document, by uploading their photos, the terrible effects of climate change and start, when possible, fundraising to help the victims of natural disasters
